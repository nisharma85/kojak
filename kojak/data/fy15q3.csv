Glad we could help find the defect, but it was PAINFUL to get to that point.   Many other features of Wily we NEED ( because our developers are not so good ), but they don't work.

Example: issues remain collecting information on Solaris containers; memory metrics on AIX LPARs are no longer reported. Suggests that your marketing and pre-sales folks are put in a bind when the technical portion does not measure up. Subsquently, we still have not completed the 2011 migration from NSM, which is still active.Unable to collect process statistics without having an element for each process. With 2000 physical and virtual servers, this adds excessive overhead to the infrastructure making process collection each server not feasible. Unable to organize process groups into a single element without having all processes defined, each as an element. Process collections are required for the Capacity Manager to produce relevant models as well. Disappointing as this was marketed as doable.Monitoring and Capacity Management are not the same. Capacity Management requires data collection not just threshold capture. Data that may be captured is only accessible via the portal for eHealth or NetQos. While there are many good reports and data aggregations present, there is no viable ability to data mine these repositories to organize data in the manor our management and customers would like to see.The Capacity Manager was reported to run of RHEL compiled for IBM z/LINUX; it does not function (one of our techies found that java was compiled for solaris in the POC we ran). We have NSM still active and have history files that we wanted to introduce into Capacity Manager (Hyperformix), but CA does not support these your own files. We were told to use the SDK to develop our own. We also lead to believe that this product could take in SAN Storage frame data, but does not handle all of the major vendors (Hitachi). Presently, this product is shelf-ware and I am not certain management will permit time and resources for another look. This could have been a good reporting and modeling product if we could input the data that we collect here (partly due to a lack of a testing environment due to expansive resource requirement of eHealth and NetQoS, and the continuum of functional problems.APM is a grand idea and one liked by executive management, but appears not doable within our environment due the cost of resources and impact to our customer base. I learned that some of the products had to have specific transaction defined in order to capture packets - this can and should be done simpler. CMG had an APM initiative in the 90's that was simpler but did not catch on.  your SOI product look very interesting with its inception, but did not pan out.The integration of enterprise data sources has not been successful at our site. Once integration was a corner stone of CA Unicenter.

The thing that CA can do to make your products better is to make integrating ALL of your products with your own CA SiteMinder product EASIER!! It seems like the hardest integrations we have with CASM is with other CA tools like CA IdentityMinder, CA Service Desk, CA Oblicore and CA Clarity. We actually had to let the Oblicore team go into production without CASM because CA could not help us resolve a problem with CA Oblicore that was happening with CASM enabled in the QA environment. To this day, Oblicore is still not protected by SiteMinder at FDC. We are hoping that we will be able to get CASM involved at the start of the CA Oblicore upgrade to CA BSM. We started discussing protecting CA Clarity with CASM 3 years ago, and it was going to be so involved, that it was put on hold; we still are not protecting CA Clarity at FDC with CASM. It seems like it should be a ""No Brainer"" to have the CA products be seamlessly integratable with thier own Authentication & Authorization tool. If your engeneering department can do this, this alone could go a LONG way to making the CA products more recommendable!! As for CA IdentityMinder - I can't recomend this product, simply because it has been a nightmare for us in our internal environment. Externally it has been more stable, but we have been ""burned"" so many times, that we have started pulling capabilities out of it.CA FederationManager was a joke of a security product! The administrative console can only be accessed by using ONE administrative ID!! Rule number 1 in authentication and access management ""Do not share administrative accounts"", but that is exactly what has to happen in order to log into this tool. It still shocks me that this tool ever made it to the public market.CA has some really great products, but your reputation get's burned because of a few very bad products, that shouldn't have been released in the first place. Instead of trying to have a product to please every one, or every business use case, how about sticking with just the products that CA has that are REALLY good? Just a thought.....",,Negative,Product_Scope,Integrations,Positive,Product_Quality,Products working as expected,,,,6,6,6,,,"Having more visability into what teams within FDC are doing what with the other CA products would be helpful. My team supports the CA SiteMinder tool. We are trying to deliver Single Sign On across the company to deliver Employee Enablement, make our employees more efficent. It's hard for us to help ensure that we are involved in protecting applications at the front door, if we don't know about them. If CA can help us by instigating contact between my team and other project teams who might be going through a new CA product deployment or upgrade, that would be great. That would help us to get CA SiteMinder involved early on, Single Sign On rolled out more effectively, and help join forces between FDC and CA. a Win Win for everyone!I know that the CA relations teams are interested in helping to keep an eye out for the product teams, and make sure that ""problems"" don't arise, but sometimes it seems like problems actually arise, because of the attempts to avoid problems. Don't forget to communicate with the ""worker bee's"" who truly ""know"" whats going on.

We'll be on a call with one resource during one support ticket who will suggest that we make xyz changes, so we do, then later will be on a call and they will tell us that we really should have xyz enabled! Well it was CA who told us to change xyz, so it isn't enabled. Or CA consultants came in and advised that we design things a certain way, and this was supposed to be best practice. Then we have another group of CA people come in who tell us that what we are doing is wrong and it should be done another way. It seems like no one at CA can agree on how things should actually be done in a tool! It is unbelieveably frsutrating when all we want to know is ""how should we be doing this the right way?""Technical Support is often the same way, but rated higher because some of the support resources are very helpful and do respond quickly. Other times they don't respond timely, aren't available except for very limited abounts of time to work on the problem (30 minutes isn't enough time to work on a technical problem), or just continue to ask for more and more logs to review, without ever coming back with some sort of a response on what might be the problem. When an issue drags on for too long, my team can typical resolve the problem before CA support figures it out.",,Negative,Support,Knowledge of reps,Negative,Account_Team_Relationship,Understand my business needs,,,,Y

Our current CA offerings need to be solid, well maintained, and kept up to date before I would look at acquiring additional products. Please understand that I championed bringing in  additional CA products a few years ago, only to be disappointed in their maturity, quality, ease of implementation and documentation. I would like to see CA invest in what they currently offer before I would be comfortable in repeating that experience. If you are going to market a product, make sure its ready for prime time and that the training and documentation is first rate. It takes a long time to recover from a bad first impression and in some cases you won't get a second chance. I still see rough edges on CA products that have been in use for many years.  Why?
